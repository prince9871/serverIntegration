# ðŸŽ“ Student Data Management System

This project demonstrates the integration between a React frontend, Express backend, and MongoDB database. It allows you to **view**, **add**, **update**, and **delete** student data with two fields: **name** and **age**. You can also observe **live changes** in the application when data is modified directly from **MongoDB Compass**.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB:** [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
